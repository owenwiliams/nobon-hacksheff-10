## Inspiration
The _"Odyssey"_ theme directed us immediately towards the Greek myth of the same name. We were inspired to create an app that directs the user through a sea of tasks and milestones, be it short-term or long-term, navigating past problems and avoidable tasks - the sirens. It guides you through your own personal odyssey.

## What it does
AI is used to collaborate with the user, similar to Athena's divine assistance in the odyssey. Upon telling the AI your goals and plans, the user will be guided through a series of tasks to reach the end goal - Ithaca.

## How we built it
We built it using a mix of Python, some python libraries, HTML, CSS, and JS using React. We utilised Google Gemini's API to implement an AI chatbot of our own, giving it its own ruleset and custom prompts.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge came with attempting to force progress with an approach that was really not optimal. Our approaches should have been planned and considered more thoroughly beforehand through research. An example of this is having to rewrite the code for the web app into using a proper implementation of ReactJS due to starting with minimal research, as well as similar problems on the backend side using Python.
